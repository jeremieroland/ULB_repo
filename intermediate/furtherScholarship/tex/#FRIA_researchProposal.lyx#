Goals of the Research
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Current information processing models are fundamentally limited in terms
 of speed, efficiency, security and privacy, as they assume a simplified
 representation of the world, relying on classical physics.
 In the past few decades, research in the field of quantum information processin
g has been carried out to break this barrier by exploiting quantum phenomena.
 This has led to breakthrough results such as Bennett and Brassard's information
aly secure quantum key distribution protocol
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and Shor's efficient factoring algorithm

\end_inset

 which suggest that future large-scale network of computing devices will
 be able to communicate both efficiently and securely using quantum resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite steady progress, including practical implementations of quantum
 key distribution schemes, there are both technological limitations and
 theoretical barriers.
 The development of algorithms and protocols exploiting such a quantum network
 to its full capacity is also hindered by the inherent difficulty at characteriz
ing interactive quantum communication models.
 As a consequence, only limited techniques are known for studying quantum
 communication complexity, and the development of fundamental cryptographic
 primitives such as quantum coin flipping requires complicated tools that
 make it extremely hard to derive explicit protocols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The overall aim of this research project is to take a fresh start towards
 quantum communication protocols by approaching their theoretical foundations
 from a new perspective.
 More precisely, our objectives are the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

time Hamiltonian evolution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 and matching efficient protocols.

\begin_layout Subsection
State of the Art
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Communication complexity is a computational model first introduced by Yao
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Yao79"

\end_inset

 where two distant players, Alice and Bob, each receive an input, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, respectively, and their goal is to compute a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y)$
\end_inset

.
 To this end, they must communicate, and the communication complexity is
 defined as the minimum number of bits exchanged by Alice and Bob in order
 to compute the function with error at most 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 In addition to being a quite natural computational model on its own, communicat
ion complexity also found many applications, not only for proving bounds
 via reductions for other computational models (decision trees, streaming
 algorithms), but also for more practical problems such as the design of
 VLSI circuits (see also [KN97->add to bibtex file]).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this reason, communication complexity has been extensively studied but
 progress has been quite slow due to the difficulty at developing good lower
 and upper bound techniques.
 In particular, the famous log-rank conjecture [LS88->add to bibtex file],
 which states that the communication complexity of a function is bounded
 from above by a constant power of the rank of its communication matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{x,y}=f(x,y)$
\end_inset

 remains open despite decades of attempts to prove it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Over the last few years, a new approach to communication complexity problems
 based on information theory [define this? Not sure it is necessary] has
 attracted a lot of interest.
 This approach can not only be used to prove lower bounds on the usual model,
 but also leads to a new model called information complexity, where the
 cost of a communication protocol no longer corresponds to the length of
 the communicated messages, but rather to their information content (see
 e.g.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bra12"

\end_inset

).
 Information complexity is also equivalent to amortized communication complexity
 [BW12->add to bibtex file], and therefore leads to an interactive analogue
 of Shannon compression [define shannon compression first maybe? I think
 it is fine].
 It has recently been shown that some lower bound techniques for communication
 complexity also lower bound information complexity
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "KLL+14"

\end_inset

.
 These techniques draw an interesting connection with the notion of Bell
 inequalities studied in the context of quantum nonlocality, which makes
 it possible to define natural extensions of these lower bound techniques
 to quantum communication complexity
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LLR12"

\end_inset

, an extension of communication complexity where the players can exchange
 quantum messages.
 This line of research is quite promising as the set of lower bound techniques
 for quantum communication complexity is currently even more limited than
 for its classical counterpart.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that closely related computational models are much better understood,
 such as quantum query complexity [define it? WE could say that this is
 the quantum analogue of query complexity or “decision tree complexity”,
 but we don’t have enough space to define it in more details], which in
 the bounded-error case is now known to be characterized by a semidefinite
 program called the adversary bound
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "LMRSS11"

\end_inset

.
 The proof of this fundamental result is facilitated by considering a generaliza
tion of the model where the goal is not to compute a function but rather
 to generate a quantum state
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "AMRR11"

\end_inset

.
 More recently, an alternative proof of this was provided by my promoter
 by considering a continuous-time model of quantum query complexity

\begin_layout Standard
Coin flipping is a fundamental cryptographic primitive where two distrustful
 parties need to remotely generate a shared unbiased random bit.
 A cheating player can try to bias the output bit towards a preferred value.
 For weak coin flipping, each player has a given preferred value: for example,
 Alice wants to bias towards 0 while Bob wants to bias towards 1.
 A weak coin-flipping protocol has bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 if neither Alice nor Bob can force the outcome towards her/his preferred
 value with probability more than 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2+\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 For strong coin flipping, there is no a priori preferred values, and the
 protocol has bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 if neither Alice nor Bob can force the outcome towards any value with probabili
ty more than 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2+\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 Under information-theoretic security, neither weak nor strong coin flipping
 is possible with non-trivial bias in the classical setting: there always
 exists a player that can force any outcome with probability 1.
 However, the situation is quite different in the quantum world.
 Indeed, strong coin-flipping protocols with bias strictly less than 
\begin_inset Formula $1/2$
\end_inset

 have been shown, the best known explicit protocol having bias 
\begin_inset Formula $1/4$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ambainis04b"

\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless, Kitaev showed a lower bound of 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\sqrt{2}-1/2$
\end_inset

 for the bias of any quantum strong coin flipping
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kitaev03"

\end_inset

, so an arbitrary small bias is not possible.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for weak coin flipping, explicit protocols have been shown with bias
 as low as 
\begin_inset Formula $1/6$
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mochon05"

\end_inset

.
 In a breakthrough result, Mochon even proved in 2007 the existence of a
 quantum weak coin-flipping protocol with bias 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

, hence showing that near-perfect weak coin flipping is theoretically possible
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mochon07"

\end_inset

.
 This fundamental result for quantum cryptography unfortunately comes with
 the important drawback that the proof of existence is non-constructive:
 indeed, it is based on successive reductions from a protocol to different
 versions of so-called point games, a formalism introduced by Kitaev in
 order to study coin flipping.
 As a consequence, the structure of the protocol whose existence is proved
 is unfortunately lost during a long and technical sequence of reductions
 (the article is 80-page long).
 Moreover, this article was never peer-reviewed, and it took years before
 the proof was systematically verified by independent researchers.
 While this verification also led to a simplified version of the proof
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "ACG+14"

\end_inset

 (only 50-page long!), to this date, more than 9 years after the original
 proof of existence, nobody has been able to turn it into an explicit weak
 coin-flipping protocol.
 This is not due to a lack of trying: experts have used various approaches
 ranging from distilling a protocol from the theoretical proof of existence
 to numerical search.
 For example, despite many optimization techniques, the extensive numerical
 calculations in
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "NST14"

\end_inset

 did not return a single protocol with a better bias than what was previously
 known.
 While this last reference concerns strong coin-flipping protocols, the
 problems are closely related, as it was shown that an explicit quantum
 protocol for weak coin flipping would provide, via black-box reductions,
 optimal protocols for strong coin flipping
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and oblivious transfer (another fundamental cryptographic primitive) as
 well
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This makes the absence of explicit weak coin-flipping protocols even more
 frustrating.

Continuous-time communication.

\series default
 The main originality of my research project is to consider a continuous-time
 model to study communication complexity and cryptographic primitives.
 This is in sharp contrast with the state of the art where virtually all
 interactive communication models assume discrete-time protocols, where
 the communication travels back and forth between the communicating players.
 The continuous-time model I propose to study assumes that the players interact
 via a shared ``messaging'' system that can be coupled continuously in time
 to their local workspace.
 More precisely, assume that Alice and Bob have private quantum registers
 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, and share a common message register 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 Alice can apply a Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{A}$
\end_inset

 to her register and an interaction Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{AM}$
\end_inset

 to the combined system composed of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly Bob can apply 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{B}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{BM}$
\end_inset

.
 The complete Hamiltonian may be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $H=H_{A}\otimes\mathbb{I}_{MB}+H_{AM}\otimes\mathbb{I}_{B}+\mathbb{I}_{A}\otimes H_{MB}+\mathbb{I}_{AM}\otimes H_{B}.$
\end_inset

 Note that the traditional discrete-time communication model can be seen
 as a special case of this model where at any point in time, either 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{AM}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{BM}$
\end_inset

 is zero.
 Conversely, any continuous-time protocol may be approached by a discrete-time
 protocol via a Trotter expansion.
 For this reason, the continuous-time model also provides a new approach
 to study the usual discrete-time model.
 The first task of our PhD project will be to formalize this general framework
 of continuous-time communication and its connection the usual discrete-time
 model, before we can use this framework in different contexts, namely communica
tion complexity and the design of cryptographic primitives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Communication complexity.

\series default
 We can define a continuous-time model of communication complexity by considerin
g the time required to evolve the system to the desired state as a measure
 of complexity (for this measure to be non-trivial, we need to impose energy
 constraints, in that the norms of 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{AM}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{BM}$
\end_inset

 must be bounded by some constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\le1$
\end_inset

).
 An important task will be to prove tight bounds between the usual (discrete-tim
e) model and this new model, using the general connection described above.
 From there, we propose to develop new techniques to bound the continuous-time
 communication complexity, which will in turn imply new bounds for the usual
 model.
 Note that the most powerful known methods to prove bounds on communication
 complexity require combinatorial techniques, due to the combinatorial structure
 of interactive protocols where messages are sent back and forth.
 It is quite likely that the algebraic structure of continuous-time protocols
 might lead to a simpler analysis and therefore bound techniques that are
 easier to apply (note that there also exist algebraic bound techniques
 for the usual model of communication complexity, but while they are typically
 easier to apply they are also less powerful and therefore sometimes not
 sufficient).
 Another modification of the model we propose to exploit is an extension
 to quantum state generation, where instead of computing a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y)$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 are Alice’s and Bob’s inputs), the goal is to create a joint quantum state
 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{xy}$
\end_inset

.
 This extension was quite useful to simplify the study, up to the full character
ization, of quantum query complexity, and we hope to benefit from the same
 advantage here.
 Indeed, even if the initial and final states of a protocol are taken from
 a finite set of possibilities, as is the case when computing a function,
 intermediate states of the protocol can be arbitrary, and focusing on the
 singular properties of the states at the beginning and the end of the protocol
 might obscure the general dynamical properties.
 This is especially true for the continuous-time model I propose to explore,
 since in that case the intermediate states of the protocol follow a continuous
 path in the Hilbert space.
 In order to design new techniques to prove lower bounds on this extended
 model, I propose to combine these new ideas to recent techniques for the
 usual discrete-time models, in particular techniques based on information
 theory, as well as bounds derived from the notion of Bell inequalities
 studied in the context of quantum non-locality [see above, maybe add the
 same references here].
 Finally, we also intend to study continuous time models in the purview
 of classical communication complexity where the Schrödinger equation is
 replaced by appropriate Euler Lagrange equations and is expected to yield
 a unified characterization of communication complexity.
 We intend to study similar questions; equivalence between continuous and
 discrete models and characterization of complexity models using new bounding
 techniques.

Cryptography.

 Constructing explicit optimal quantum protocols for cryptographic primitives
 will be among the second main targets of this project (see Figure XXX).
 We will first focus on weak coin flipping, not only because it can lead
 via reductions to protocols for other primitives such as strong coin flipping
 and bit commitment
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CK09,CK11"

\end_inset

, but also because my promoter has already obtained some promising preliminary
 results.
 More precisely, he has recently discovered that the best known quantum
 protocol for weak coin flipping
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mochon05"

\end_inset

, achieving bias 
\begin_inset Formula $1/6$
\end_inset

, can be obtained by discretizing a continuous-time communication protocol
 of the type we have defined above.
 This construction gives more insight on how the protocol works and therefore
 provides a new approach to extend it and break the limit of bias 
\begin_inset Formula $1/6$
\end_inset

, which resisted all researchers for more than a decade.
 Indeed, while Mochon's original construction requires taking the limit
 of an infinite number of discrete steps, this new construction immediately
 yields a protocol as a continuous evolution, which is easier to analyze
 and provides more intuition.
 Our strategy will be to exploit this new intuition to finally break the
 barrier corresponding to bias 
\begin_inset Formula $1/6$
\end_inset

.
 In order to do so, we propose to adapt to this framework a technique introduced
 by Feynman in his early works on quantum computers
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Feynman86"

\end_inset

, consisting in constructing the history state of a computation, that is,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Psi\right\rangle =\sum_{t=0}^{T}\left|\psi_{t}\right\rangle \left|t\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 We believe that this might be the key to obtaining better biases, because
 this states involves at the same ``physical time'' all states of the protocol
 at different ``logical'' times, and therefore has a structure which is
 very similar to the so-called ``time-independent point games'' that Mochon
 used to prove (in a non-constructive manner) the existence of protocols
 with arbitrarily low biases
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mochon07"

\end_inset

.
 In the case of a continuous-time protocol, the history state reads 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Psi\right\rangle =\int_{t=0}^{T}\left|\psi(t)\right\rangle \left|t\right\rangle dt$
\end_inset

, where the clock register 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|t\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 holds a continuous variable, and is therefore infinite-dimensional.
 The fact that the time-independent point games for bias less than 
\begin_inset Formula $1/6$
\end_inset

 might actually correspond to a continuous-time history state, which would
 imply that an infinite-dimensional register is necessary to translate with
 no loss the point games into explicit protocols, could explain all the
 failed attempts at obtaining such protocols.
 Once a first protocol with bias less than 
\begin_inset Formula $1/6$
\end_inset

 is obtained, the obvious next step will be to decrease the bias further,
 up to an arbitrary low bias, that is, an optimal protocol.
 In order to do so, our main strategy will be to iterate the process allowing
 to break the initial barrier, combining history states, continuous-time
 evolution and continuous variables.
 Next, we will turn our attention to other cryptographic primitives such
 as strong coin flipping and bit commitment.
 It is known that an optimal quantum protocol for weak coin flipping immediately
 yields by reduction optimal protocols for these other primitives as well
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "CK09,CK11"

\end_inset

, but it is quite likely that the reduction leads to unnecessary overhead
 in terms of time and space.
 Our goal will therefore be to make these protocols as efficient as possible
 by simplifying the protocols obtained by reduction, or by directly constructing
 optimal protocols for these primitives using similar techniques as for
 weak coin flipping.
 From optimal continuous-time quantum protocols for these cryptographic
 primitives, the next final step will be to derive explicit discrete-time
 protocols.
 Here we will use the general framework we developed to study continuous-time
 quantum communication protocols and their connection with discrete-time
 protocols.
 Again, an important challenge will be to reduce the overhead in terms of
 time and space.
 However, we also plan to use optical quadratures to implement continuous
 variable registers, an overarching goal being to obtain protocols that
 only involve operations that could be realistically implemented.
 Specifically, a decomposition into Gaussian operations would be preferred
 to enable easy experimental implementation.
 The effect of imperfections must also be modelled to quantify loss of security
 and robustness thereof.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we also intend to explore the cryptographic variant of quantum
 communication complexity, where the players wish to reveal as little informatio
n as possible about their inputs 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y)$
\end_inset

 while computing 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y)$
\end_inset

.
 This can be achieved by first considering an ‘honest-but-curious’ model
 which is classically equivalent to information complexity.
 The quantum version is, however, not as clear where multiple definitions
 of quantum information complexity coexist but they do not necessarily yield
 the actual information achievable by the players.
 We intend to arrive at a more suitable definition using new techniques
 based on a continuous-time model.
 The malicious case can be subsequently considered with the history state
 being harnessed to detect cheating.

The Centre for Quantum Information and Communication (QuIC) has been active
 in quantum information sciences for more than fifteen years, with research
 contributions ranging from fundamental questions such as quantum measurement,
 quantum entanglement, or quantum nonlocality, to more information-flavored
 issues such as quantum communication, quantum cryptography, or quantum
 algorithms.
 It has invented and contributed to the demonstration of the first continuous-va
riable (Gaussian) quantum cryptographic protocol.
 It currently holds two patents, and has published numerous scientific papers
 among which two in the journal Nature, one in Nature Photonics, and one
 in Nature Communications.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
QuIC also benefits from a large network of collaboration with other institutions
 throughout Europe (e.g.
 IRIF Paris, CWI Amsterdam, Cambridge, ULatvia), North America (e.g.
 MIT, UWaterloo, BBN Technologies) and Asia (CQT Singapore), and participated
 in many collaborative European projects on quantum information, including
 most recently SECOQC, QAP, QUROPE, COVAQIAL (coordinator), COMPAS (coordinator)
, QCS, DIQIP, HIPERCOM (coordinator), QALGO and QUCHIP.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large fraction of QuIC research activities has focused on quantum information
 with continuous-variable carriers.
 In particular, the QuIC has reported on the first demonstration of continuous-v
ariable quantum key distribution in collaboration with the Institut d'Optique
 d'Orsay.
 More recently, the QuIC has developed an important research activity in
 the general field of quantum computer science.
 In particular, my promoter has made important contributions to adiabatic
 quantum computation

SUMMARY OF MASTER'S THESIS OR EQUIVALENT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (QM) asserts that the
 wave-function is the most complete description, which entails that there
 is an inherent fuzziness in our description of nature.
 There exists a completion of QM, known as Bohmian Mechanics (BM), which
 replaces this fuzziness with precision, and re-introduces notions of physical
 trajectories.
 Various interesting questions arise, solely by the existence of such a
 description; doesn't it contradict the uncertainty principle, for instance.
 Most of these questions were found to have been addressed satisfactorily
 in the literature.
 There was, however, one question, whose answer has become the subject of
 his investigation; that of the paradoxical co-existence of contextuality
 and BM.
 In a theory that can predict the value of operators, the value an operator
 takes, must depend on the state of the system (including hidden variables).
 Contextuality arguments show that the value an operator takes, must also
 depend on the complete set of compatible operators, to be consistent with
 QM.
 BM being deterministic, is at complete odds with this notion.
 After various attempts he was able to show, that the notion of contextuality
 is in fact not necessary.
 This was achieved by identifying another `classical property' and constructing
 a non-contextual toy-model, serving as a counter-example to the impossibility
 proof.
 The toy model has been generalised to a discrete but arbitrarily sized
 Hilbert space, consistent with all predictions of QM.
 Implications of violation of this `classical property' were explored, in
 particular, to the notion of non-locality.
