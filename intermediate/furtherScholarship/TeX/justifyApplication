Current information processing models are fundamentally limited in terms of speed, efficiency, security and privacy, as they assume a simplified representation of the world, relying on classical physics. In the past few decades, research in the field of quantum information processing promises to break this barrier by achieving the highest security and efficiency allowed by the laws of physics, which suggests that future large-scale network of computing devices will be able to communicate both efficiently and securely using quantum resources.

Quantum key distribution, for instance, has now even been demonstrated with continuous variables (a second generation task) by QuIC theory group at ULB in collaboration with the Institut d'Optique d'Orsay. Development of quantum technologies is at its pinnacle with the latest being the launch of the first quantum satellite by China. While there are various technical and theoretical challenges still to be addressed, it is reasonable to conclude that in the long term the results obtained from this project will contribute to the commercialising the use of quantum resources.
