@article{DKLR11,
	Abstract = {We study a model of communication complexity that encompasses many well-studied problems, including classical and quantum communication complexity, the complexity of simulating distributions arising from bipartite measurements of shared quantum states, and XOR games. In this model, Alice gets an input \$x\$, Bob gets an input \$y\$, and their goal is to each produce an output \$a,b\$ distributed according to some pre-specified joint distribution \$p(a,b|x,y)\$. Our results apply to any non-signaling distribution, that is, those where Alice's marginal distribution does not depend on Bob's input, and vice versa. By taking a geometric view of the non-signaling distributions, we introduce a simple new technique based on affine combinations of lower-complexity distributions, and we give the first general technique to apply to all these settings, with elementary proofs and very intuitive interpretations. Specifically, we introduce two complexity measures, one which gives lower bounds on classical communication, and one for quantum communication. These measures can be expressed as convex optimization problems. We show that the dual formulations have a striking interpretation, since they coincide with maximum violations of Bell and Tsirelson inequalities. The dual expressions are closely related to the winning probability of XOR games. Despite their apparent simplicity, these lower bounds subsume many known communication complexity lower bound methods, most notably the recent lower bounds of Linial and Shraibman for the special case of Boolean functions. We show that as in the case of Boolean functions, the gap between the quantum and classical lower bounds is at most linear in the size of the support of the distribution, and does not depend on the size of the inputs. This translates into a bound on the gap between maximal Bell and Tsirelson inequality violations, which was previously known only for the case of distributions with Boolean outcomes and uniform marginals. It also allows us to show that for some distributions, information theoretic methods are necessary to prove strong lower bounds. Finally, we give an exponential upper bound on quantum and classical communication complexity in the simultaneous messages model, for any non-signaling distribution. One consequence of this is a simple proof that any quantum distribution can be approximated with a constant number of bits of communication.},

	Abstract = {It is known that quantum correlations exhibited by a maximally entangled qubit pair can be simulated with the help of shared randomness, supplemented with additional resources, such as communication, post-selection or non-local boxes. For instance, in the case of projective measurements, it is possible to solve this problem with protocols using one bit of communication or making one use of a non-local box. We show that this problem reduces to a distributed sampling problem. We give a new method to obtain samples from a biased distribution, starting with shared random variables following a uniform distribution, and use it to build distributed sampling protocols. This approach allows us to derive, in a simpler and unified way, many existing protocols for projective measurements, and extend them to positive operator value measurements. Moreover, this approach naturally leads to a local hidden variable model for Werner states.},

	Abstract = {We solve an open problem by constructing quantum walks that not only detect but also find marked vertices in a graph. The number of steps of the quantum walk is quadratically smaller than the classical hitting time of any reversible random walk P on the graph. Our approach is new, simpler and more general than previous ones. We introduce a notion of interpolation between the walk P and the absorbing walk P′, whose marked states are absorbing. Then our quantum walk is simply the quantum analogue of the interpolation. Contrary to previous approaches, our results remain valid when the random walk P is not state-transitive, and in the presence of multiple marked vertices. As a consequence we make a progress on an open problem related to the spatial search on the 2D-grid.},

	Abstract = {A non-local box is an abstract device into which Alice and Bob input bits $x$ and $y$ respectively and receive outputs $a$ and $b$, where $a,b$ are uniformly distributed and $a \oplus b = x \wedge y$. Such boxes have been central to the study of quantum or generalized non-locality, as well as the simulation of non-signaling distributions. In this paper, we start by studying how many non-local boxes Alice and Bob need in order to compute a Boolean function $f$. We provide tight upper and lower bounds in terms of the communication complexity of the function both in the deterministic and randomized case. We show that non-local box complexity has interesting applications to classical cryptography, in particular to secure function evaluation, and study the question posed by Beimel and Malkin of how many Oblivious Transfer calls Alice and Bob need in order to securely compute a function $f$. We show that this question is related to the non-local box complexity of the function and conclude by greatly improving their bounds. Finally, another consequence of our results is that traceless two-outcome measurements on maximally entangled states can be simulated with 3 non-local boxes, while no finite bound was previously known. },

abstract = {The polynomial method and the adversary method are the two main techniques to prove lower bounds on quantum query complexity, and they have so far been considered as unrelated approaches. Here, we show an explicit reduction from the polynomial method to the multiplicative adversary method. The proof goes by extending the polynomial method from Boolean functions to quantum state generation problems. In the process, the bound is even strengthened. We then show that this extended polynomial method is a special case of the multiplicative adversary method with an adversary matrix that is independent of the function. This new result therefore provides insight on the reason why in some cases the adversary method is stronger than the polynomial method. It also reveals a clear picture of the relation between the different lower bound techniques, as it implies that all known techniques reduce to the multiplicative adversary method.},

	Abstract = {We show that almost all known lower bound methods for communication complexity are also lower bounds for the information complexity. In particular, we define a relaxed version of the partition bound of Jain and Klauck and prove that it lower bounds the information complexity of any function. Our relaxed partition bound subsumes all norm based methods (e.g. the factorization norm method) and rectangle-based methods (e.g. the rectangle/corruption bound, the smooth rectangle bound, and the discrepancy bound), except the partition bound. Our result uses a new connection between rectangles and zero-communication protocols where the players can either output a value or abort. We prove the following compression lemma: given a protocol for a function f with information complexity I, one can construct a zero-communication protocol that has non-abort probability at least 2\^{}\{-O(I)\} and that computes f correctly with high probability conditioned on not aborting. Then, we show how such a zero-communication protocol relates to the relaxed partition bound. We use our main theorem to resolve three of the open questions raised by Braverman. First, we show that the information complexity of the Vector in Subspace Problem is \{$\backslash$Omega\}(n\^{}\{1/3\}), which, in turn, implies that there exists an exponential separation between quantum communication complexity and classical information complexity. Moreover, we provide an \{$\backslash$Omega\}(n) lower bound on the information complexity of the Gap Hamming Distance Problem.},

	Abstract = {In communication complexity, two players each have an input and they wish to compute some function of the joint inputs. This has been the object of much study and a wide variety of lower bound methods have been introduced to address the problem of showing lower bounds on communication. Recently, Jain and Klauck introduced the partition bound, which subsumes many of the known methods, in particular factorization norm, discrepancy, and the rectangle (corruption) bound. Physicists have considered a closely related scenario where two players share a predefined entangled state. Each is given a measurement as input, which they perform on their share of the system. The outcomes of the measurements follow a distribution which is predicted by quantum mechanics. In an experimental setting, Bell inequalities are used to distinguish truly quantum from classical behavior. We present a new lower bound technique based on the notion of detector inefficiency (where some runs are discarded by either of the players) for the extended setting of simulating distributions, and show that it coincides with the partition bound in the case of computing functions. The dual form is more feasible to use, and we show that it amounts to constructing an explicit Bell inequality. We also give a lower bound on quantum communication complexity which can be viewed as a quantum extension of the rectangle bound, effectively overcoming the necessity of a quantum minmax theorem. For one-way communication, we show that the quantum one-way partition bound is tight for classical communication with shared entanglement up to arbitrarily small error. Finally, an important goal in physics is to devise robust Bell experiments that are impervious to noise and detector inefficiency. We make further progress towards this by giving a general tradeoff between communication, Bell inequality violation, and detector efficiency.},

abstract = {We solve an open problem by constructing quantum walks that not only detect but also find marked vertices in a graph. In the case when the marked set \$M\$ consists of a single vertex, the number of steps of the quantum walk is quadratically smaller than the classical hitting time \$HT(P,M)\$ of any reversible random walk \$P\$ on the graph. In the case of multiple marked elements, the number of steps is given in terms of a related quantity \$HT\^{}+(\backslash mathit\{P,M\})\$ which we call extended hitting time. Our approach is new, simpler and more general than previous ones. We introduce a notion of interpolation between the random walk \$P\$ and the absorbing walk \$P'\$, whose marked states are absorbing. Then our quantum walk is simply the quantum analogue of this interpolation. Contrary to previous approaches, our results remain valid when the random walk \$P\$ is not state-transitive. We also provide algorithms in the cases when only approximations or bounds on parameters \$p\_M\$ (the probability of picking a marked vertex from the stationary distribution) and \$HT\^{}+(\backslash mathit\{P,M\})\$ are known.},
