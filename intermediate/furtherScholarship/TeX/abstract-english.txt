Title: A continuous-time approach towards Quantum Cryptography and Communication Complexity.

Shortened: CV Quantum Crypt. & Comm. Complexity

Current information processing models are fundamentally limited in terms of speed, efficiency, security and privacy, as they assume a simplified representation of the world, relying on classical physics. Ongoing research in the field of quantum information processing promises to break this barrier by achieving the highest security and efficiency allowed by the laws of physics, which suggests that future large-scale network of computing devices will be able to communicate both efficiently and securely using quantum resources.

However, the development of algorithms and protocols exploiting such a quantum network to its full capacity is hindered by the inherent difficulty at characterising interactive quantum communication models. This is true not only for quantum communication complexity, where few lower bound techniques are known, but also for quantum cryptographic primitives, where for example a fundamental primitive such as unconditionally secure weak coin flipping is known to be possible but pragmatically no explicit protocol is known.

The main objectives of this proposal are to prove tight bounds for quantum communication complexity and to develop optimal and realistic quantum protocols for the main cryptographic primitives. In order to fulfil those objectives, we propose to develop a new framework based on continuous-time communication protocols, where instead of sending messages back and forth, the players interact through a shared messaging system which can be coupled continuously in time to their local workspace.
